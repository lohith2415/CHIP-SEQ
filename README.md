# Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq)

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a powerful genome-wide technique used to identify DNA regions bound by specific proteins, such as transcription factors, histones, or histone modifications. This method provides insight into gene regulation, chromatin structure, and epigenetic mechanisms under different biological conditions.

In ChIP-seq, cells are first treated with a cross-linking agent (commonly formaldehyde) to stabilize protein–DNA interactions. The chromatin is then fragmented into small DNA pieces by sonication or enzymatic digestion. An antibody specific to the protein of interest is used to selectively immunoprecipitate DNA–protein complexes. After reversing the cross-links, the enriched DNA fragments are purified and subjected to next-generation sequencing.

The resulting sequencing reads are aligned to a reference genome, and regions with significant enrichment, known as peaks, are identified using peak-calling algorithms. These peaks represent genomic loci where the target protein is bound. Downstream analyses, including motif discovery, peak annotation, and integration with transcriptomic data, enable functional interpretation of regulatory elements and protein-DNA interactions.

ChIP-seq is widely used to study transcriptional regulation, epigenetic modifications, enhancer–promoter interactions, and dynamic changes in chromatin landscapes across developmental stages, environmental conditions, or disease states.
